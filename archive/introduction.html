                        <li><strong>CSC221 Advanced Python</strong> - It’s required for my major, but I also want to improve my python programming skills.</li>
                        <li><strong>CTS240 Project Management</strong> - This class will help me get an inside look on how to work with a team to get a project done using project management software.</li>
